// A ReportingPlugin allows plugging custom logic into the OCR3 protocol. The
// OCR protocol handles cryptography, networking, ensuring that a sufficient
// number of nodes is in agreement about any report, transmitting the report to
// the contract, etc... The ReportingPlugin handles application-specific logic.
// To do so, the ReportingPlugin defines a number of callbacks that are called
// by the OCR protocol logic at certain points in the protocol's execution flow.
// The report generated by the ReportingPlugin must be in a format understood by
// contract that the reports are transmitted to.
//
// We assume that each correct node participating in the protocol instance will
// be running the same ReportingPlugin implementation. However, not all nodes
// may be correct; up to f nodes be faulty in arbitrary ways (aka byzantine
// faults). For example, faulty nodes could be down, have intermittent
// connectivity issues, send garbage messages, or be controlled by an adversary.
//
// For a protocol round where everything is working correctly, follower oracles
// will call Observation, ValidateObservation, ObservationQuorum, Outcome, and
// Reports. The leader oracle will additionally call Query at the beginning of
// the round. For each report, ShouldAcceptAttestedReport will be called, iff
// the oracle is in the set of transmitters for the report. If
// ShouldAcceptAttestedReport returns true, ShouldTransmitAcceptedReport will be
// called. However, an ReportingPlugin must also correctly handle the case where
// faults occur.
//
// In particular, an ReportingPlugin must deal with cases where:
//
// - only a subset of the functions on the ReportingPlugin are invoked for a
// given round
//
// - an arbitrary number of seqnrs has been skipped between invocations of the
// ReportingPlugin
//
// - the observation returned by Observation is not included in the list of
// AttributedObservations passed to Report
//
// - a query or observation is malformed. (For defense in depth, it is also
// recommended that malformed outcomes are handled gracefully.)
//
// - instances of the ReportingPlugin run by different oracles have different
// call traces. E.g., the ReportingPlugin's Observation function may have been
// invoked on node A, but not on node B.
//
// All functions on an ReportingPlugin should be thread-safe.
//
// The execution of the functions in the ReportingPlugin is on the critical path
// of the protocol's execution. A blocking function may block the oracle from
// participating in the protocol. Functions should be designed to generally
// return as quickly as possible and honor context expiration. Context
// expiration may occur for a number of reasons, including (1) shutdown of the
// protocol instance, (2) the protocol's progression through epochs (whether
// they're abandoned or completed successfully), and (3) timeout parameters. See
// the documentation on ocr3config.PublicConfig for more information on how
// to configure timeouts.
//
// For a given OCR protocol instance, there can be many (consecutive) instances
// of an ReportingPlugin, e.g. due to software restarts. If you need
// ReportingPlugin state to survive across restarts, you should store it in the
// Outcome or persist it. A ReportingPlugin instance will only ever serve a
// single protocol instance. Outcomes and other state are are not preserved
// between protocol instances. A fresh protocol instance will start with a clean
// state. Carrying state between different protocol instances is up to the
// ReportingPlugin logic.
