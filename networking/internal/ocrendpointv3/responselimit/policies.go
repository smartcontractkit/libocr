// Interface for specifying rate-limit exceptions for responses.

// When a request is made, a response policy is used to specify if a response (or in principle multiple responses)
// should be allowed or rejected.

// Policies have to be tracked internally. Therefore, to allow proper cleanup of resources, it is critical that
// IsPolicyExpired(...) returns true when no (additional) response is expected anymore.
